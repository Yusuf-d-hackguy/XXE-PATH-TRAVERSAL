# XXE-PATH-TRAVERSAL
Week 7 — XXE &amp; Path Traversal practice, recon tooling, PortSwigger SQL/XSS labs (lab-only)
Focused on web application vulnerabilities in controlled lab environments. This week I practiced XXE (XML injection) and path traversal (lab-only), using safe tools to generate payloads and understand how these flaws are identified and exploited in test apps. I also continued recon work with Sublist3r, ffuf and gobuster, and completed additional PortSwigger SQL and XSS labs.

Purpose: document hands-on learning, proof-of-concepts (sanitized), and recommended remediations — all testing performed only on authorized, intentionally vulnerable targets. We keep showing up and learning. 🚀
